# Control PC from anywhere

- > We've 2 programs, [master.py](https://github.com/nitinkumar30/control-pc-remotely/blob/main/master.py) for server and [slave.py](https://github.com/nitinkumar30/control-pc-remotely/blob/main/slave.py) for client.  
- > Using master.py file, we can control the system having slave.py file running.  
- > Both computer should be connected to same network (as we've used 127.0.0.1)  
- > Commands can be run from remote/master computer also.
